**Name:** CHITTURI DOLA SATYA SIVA SHANKAR BABA  
**Roll No:** 23A91A05E9  
**Course:** B.Tech ‚Äì Computer Science and Engineering  
**Domain:** Blockchain, AI, Web Development  
**Network:** Sepolia Testnet  
**Wallet:** MetaMask  
**DApp:** Uniswap (Testnet)  
**Asset:** Test Ether (ETH)  

---

## ü™ô Objective  
Gain practical experience with **blockchain**, **crypto wallets**, and **decentralized applications (DApps)** by setting up a MetaMask wallet, obtaining test Ether, and performing a real transaction on a DApp in the **Sepolia Testnet** environment.  

This activity strengthened understanding of **Web3 fundamentals**, **wallet management**, and **transaction verification** on blockchain networks.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps  
1. Installed the **MetaMask** browser extension from [MetaMask.io](https://metamask.io).  
2. Created a new wallet and securely stored the **12-word seed phrase** offline.  
3. Configured MetaMask to connect to the **Sepolia Testnet**.  
4. Obtained **Test Ether (ETH)** using the [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com).  
5. Connected the wallet to the **Uniswap Testnet** DApp.  
6. Executed a **token swap** (Test ETH ‚Üí Test USDC) on Uniswap.  
7. Verified the transaction using [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io).
